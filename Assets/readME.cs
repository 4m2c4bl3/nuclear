	/*      Rows are organized from left to right, so you can 
     *      'see' what orbs should be connected to each other 
     *      via hierarchy pannel. Row 1 = top row, 2 = row 
     *      below, etc.
     *      
     *      When creating a new row, please link all transfer points
     *      to all the ones around them. To make a transfer point 
     *      active, use the 'target state' script's 'current status' 
     *      option.

     *      Please do not place a statsAndDisplay prefab in any scene
     *      other than the main menu. It transfers between all scenes
     *      and startGame makes a temporary one for testing if there
     *      is none currently displayed.
     *      
     *      Please do not touch the timer script, it is debugged already
     *      for another game.
     * 
     *      If you make any major changes or move things around 
     *      please note in here so things don't get lost or mixed up.
     *      Thanks! -- Tegan
